                                <p>Linux is an open-source operating system kernel that serves as the core component of
                                        various Linux distributions. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 and has
                                        since become a popular choice for servers, desktops, and embedded systems due to
                                        its stability, security, and flexibility.</p>

                                <h3>2. What is a Linux distribution? </h3>
                                <p>A Linux distribution, or distro, is a complete operating system built on the Linux
                                        kernel. It includes the Linux kernel, system utilities, libraries, and often a
                                        package management system. Popular Linux distributions include Ubuntu, Fedora,
                                        Debian, and CentOS, each with its own package management, desktop environment,
                                        and configuration tools.</p>

                                <h3>3. How is Linux different from other operating systems?</h3>
                                <p>Linux is open-source, which means its source code is freely available for anyone to
                                        view, modify, and distribute. This openness fosters collaboration and
                                        community-driven development. Additionally, Linux is known for its stability,
                                        security features, and efficient use of system resources. Unlike proprietary
                                        operating systems, Linux comes in various distributions, allowing users to
                                        choose one that best suits their needs.</p>

                                <h3>4. What is the terminal in Linux, and why is it used? </h3>
                                <p>The terminal, or command line interface (CLI), in Linux is a text-based interface
                                        where users can interact with the system by typing commands. It provides a
                                        powerful and efficient way to perform tasks, automate processes, and manage the
                                        system. Users can execute commands to install software, manage files, configure
                                        settings, and troubleshoot issues. The terminal is a key tool for experienced
                                        users and system administrators.</p>
